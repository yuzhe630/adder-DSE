# Cross-layer Optimization for High Speed Adders: A Pareto Driven Machine Learning Approach

## Data

The dataset is *data/adder_value.csv*. Each row contains a sequence representing prefix adder and four values indicating area, power, delay and TNS.

*data/feature_value.csv* combines the features for each instance.

## TODO

1. Update dataset with more comprehensive features;

2. Scripts for building the model.
