# Cross-layer Optimization for High Speed Adders: A Pareto Driven Machine Learning Approach

## Data

The dataset is *data/adder_value.csv*. Each row contains a sequence representing prefix adder and four values indicating area, power, delay and TNS.

*data/feature_value.csv* combines the features for each instance.
Each row corresponds to an adder instance with the format as below:

<INDEX>,<Sequence>,<SIZE>,<MFO>,<MPFO(32)>,<SPFO(32)>,<TARGET_DELAY>,<AREA>,<POWER>,<DELAY>,<TNS>

## TODO

Update dataset with different utilizations
